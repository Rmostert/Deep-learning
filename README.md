# Deep-learning

## Background
The projects in this repository will illustrate how to implement a deep neural network from first principals by making use of the gradient descent algorithm and the forward feed and backpropagation steps. We'll also make use of Keras, Tensorflow and Pytorch to simplify our prototyping of models.
